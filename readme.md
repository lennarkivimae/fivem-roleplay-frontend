# FiveM Roleplay frontend - client

These are client-side scripts for GTA 5 multiplayer modification FiveM.
This is work in progress to be roleplaying script for custom server.
This is build on typescript, react and sass

## Before you continue
* Read the official FiveM documentation on how to setup server, and it's corresponding scripts.<br>
  https://docs.fivem.net/docs/server-manual/setting-up-a-server/

* API documentation and methods can be found here:<br>
  https://docs.fivem.net/natives/

## How to install
Once you have your server setup, run:
 ```
    npm ci
 ```
* Create an .env file, example is provided
* Open server.config.js and change path for env directory. This is a quirk as process.cwd is pointing to different directory than where script is located at.
* Change fxmanifest.lua and point 'client_script' to correct path relative to where fxmanifest is located at. Which should be root folder of your gamemode. example:
```
    fx_version 'cerulean'
    game 'gta5'

    name ''
    description '(WIP) Roleplaying script'
    author 'Lenny'
    url ''

    ui_page 'client/dist/index.html'

    files {
        'client/dist/index.html',
        'client/dist/gui/gui.js',
        'client/dist/css/gui.css'
    }

    client_script 'client/dist/client.js'
    server_script 'server/dist/server.js'
```

## Development
* For development and watch for file changes, run:
```
    npm run dev
```

## Production
* WIP

I might have forgotten something in the process.... have fun!
